About the Project
====
Project Kaptara is the internal codename of our first attempt at making a retro platform video game. It will have a 1980s 8-bit aesthetic and it will be inspired and influenced by several flip-screen games of this genre that were popular among ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC users. 

Game Premise
====
- The plot of the game takes place in the Bronze Age, on the island of Crete - the era and homeplace of the civilization we now call "Minoan". The player must explore the game's screens and gather the ingredients and implements the High Priestess needs to prepare the cure for the sacred bull. Without this, the great festival with which the people will thank the Mother Goddess and the other deities for the crop and the wealth granted to them in the previous year, and ask for their favor for the next one, cannot take place.
- *Kaptara*, *Kabturi* or *Caphtor* are names given by Syrian Cuneiform tablets, texts from Ugarit, and Biblical texts to a place that is generally accepted as being Crete. See https://www.livius.org/articles/place/crete/
