game premise
====
Around 3800 years before our time, on the great island we now know as Crete, preparations for the great annual religious festival in Knossos were in full swing. With the and ceremonies of this festival, and especially the Taurokathapsia (Bull-leaping) ritual, the Keftiu (Minoans) would thank the Mother Goddess and the other deities for the crop and the wealth granted to them in the previous year, and ask for their favor for the next one. 

Alas, the sacred bulls who would be the stars of the Taurokathapsia have fallen gravely ill. You, the most capable of the bull-leapers, must travel to various locations and retrieve the ingredients and implements the High Priestess needs to prepare the potion that will cure the bulls in time for the ceremonies. Your journey will take you through lavish palaces, mystical caves, lush forests, and dark mines, where you will face all manner of adversaries and obstacles!
