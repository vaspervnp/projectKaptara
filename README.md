Game Premise
====
Around 3800 years ago, on the great island we now know as Crete, preparations for the great annual festival in Knossos were in full swing. The Keftiu, the people we now known as the Minoans, would thank the Mother Goddess and the other deities for the crop and the wealth granted to them in the previous year, and ask for their favor for the next one. 

Alas, the sacred bull, the star of the festival and the bull-leaping event, has fallen gravely ill. Now, you, the most capable of the bull-leapers, must travel across the island to collect the ingredients and implements the High Priestess needs to prepare the cure for the bull in time for the ceremonies. Your journey will take you through lavish palaces, mystical caves, lush forests, and dark mines, in an adventure full of challenges and obstacles!
