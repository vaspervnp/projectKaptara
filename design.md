Player Character
====
- Size relevant to Action Window height:

  - Jump
  - Climb
  - Crouch / Duck
  - Crouch walk / Crawl (left-right)

- Weapons:
  - Dagger
  - Slingshot

- Weapon Usage Method and Mechanics:
  - Dagger: Thrown straight and its trajectory is subject to gravity
  - Slingshot: Fires at a variable angle and follows an optimal ballistic trajectory
  - The range of the dagger depends on how long the fire button / key is pressed before being released
    - Maximum dagger range: whole screen length
    - The dagger can kill two or more targets if all of them are in its path
  - The range and angle of the slingshot's projectile depend on how long the fire button / key is pressed before being released
    - Maximum slingshot projectile range: whole screen length
    - Angle of slingshot projectile respective to horizontal axis: 45Â° (for optimal ballistic trajectory)
  - Weapons / projectiles thrown cannot kill anything in other screens
  - Weapons / projectiles thrown kill enemies instantly

- Movement (left-right) / Crouch:
  - Walking speed: 1 Player Character width/step
  - Crouch walk is 50% slower
  - Crouching / ducking allows the character to dodge projectiles flying above her waist

- Jump: 
  - Vertical
  - Diagonal (see Opera Soft's "Goody")
  - Jumping allows the character to dodge projectiles flying below her waist
  - Jump height: 1 Player Character height 

- Climb:

    - Health (Hit Points)
    - Food
    - Water
  - Rate of energy depletion as a function of time:
    - Health: N/A
    - Food: 5%/min
    - Water: 5%/min
  - Rate of energy replenishment as a function of collecting power-ups:
    - Health:
      - Health-specific item: replenish to 100%
      - Food: replenishes 25% of maximum Health
      - Water: replenishes 25% of maximum Health
    - Food:
      - Health-specific item: replenishes 10% of maximum Food
      - Food: replenish to 100%
      - Water: replenishes 10% of maximum Food
    - Water: 
      - Health-specific item: replenishes 10% of maximum Water
