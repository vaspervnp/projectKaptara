Game Description (for mini-site, PR material, & physical packaging)
====
Around 3800 years ago, on the great island we now know as Crete, the Keftiu, the people we now call Minoans, are preparing for the great annual festival of Knossos. With this festival, they'll thank the Mother Goddess for the crop and the wealth She granted to them in the previous year, and ask for Her favor for the next one.

Alas, the sacred bull, the star of the festival and the bull-leaping event, has fallen gravely ill. Now, you, the most capable of the bull-leapers, must travel across the island to collect the ingredients the High Priestess needs to prepare the cure for the bull in time for the ceremonies. Your journey will take you through lavish palaces, mystical caves, lush forests, and dark mines, in an adventure full of challenges and obstacles!
